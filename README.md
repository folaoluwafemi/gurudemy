# Gurudemy

An app to help people on their learning journey. This project is meant to lean more towards "
explorative" programming (e.g. [mixins](lib/src/utils/mixins)
, [extensions](lib/src/utils/extensions), super_enums, records, patterns...etc).

# Server

The server will also be built with dart (shelf or angel3).
